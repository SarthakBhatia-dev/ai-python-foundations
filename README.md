Hi!  
I am a Class 11 PCM student (17 years old), beginning my journey into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a strong focus on building core foundations required in this field.


## About this repository
This repository documents my journey of learning Artificial Intelligence from the basics,
focusing on core concepts, mindset, and foundations required to grow in this field.

Python is used as a supporting tool wherever required to understand and implement AI concepts.


## My Goals
- Build strong foundations in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Understand core concepts step by step from basics to advanced
- Use Python as a tool to implement and practice AI concepts
- Build a strong technical profile over time
  

## Learning mindset
I believe learning from basics and practicing consistently  
is the key to long-term success in AI.

This repository will grow as I grow.
